# GPIO-18-OFF.py - This is a Python script designed to shut down
# GPIO line 18 if it was still set to True when a test application
# exited.

# Load the GPIO interface from the Raspberry Pi Python Module
# The GPIO interface will be available through the GPIO object
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Setup the GPIO interface
#
# 1. Turn off warnings for now - they can be useful for debugging more
#    complex code.
# 2. Tell the GPIO library we are using Broadcom pin-numbering. The 
#    Raspberry Pi CPU is manufactured by Broadcom, and they have a 
#    specific numbering scheme for the GPIO pins. It does not match
#    the layout on the header. However, the Broadcom pin numbering is
#    what is printed on the GPIO Breakout Board, so this should match!
# 3. Tell the GPIO library that we are using GPIO line 18, and that 
#    we are using it for Output. When this state is configured, setting
#    the GPIO line to true will provide positive voltage on that pin.
#    Based on the circuit we have built, positive voltage on the GPIO
#    pin will flow through the LED, through the resistor to the ground
#    pin and the LED will light up. 
GPIO.setwarnings(False)
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)

# Set GPIO line 18 to False - disable output voltage
# This turns off voltage output to whatever may be connected to 
# GPIO line 18.
GPIO.output(18, False)
